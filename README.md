How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by focusing on their goals and identifying the features that will provide the most value. Creating user stories helps transform those needs into actionable development tasks. During the SNHU Travel project, user stories guided the creation of features like the trip search and booking process. Each story clarified what the user wanted and why, helping the team build targeted solutions that met real expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development iteratively by focusing on building core features first and improving them over time based on feedback. Through this course, I’ve seen how Agile processes like sprint planning, daily standups, retrospectives, and backlog refinement help teams stay organized and adaptable. One key takeaway was learning to shift priorities mid-sprint when stakeholders requested new features. I plan to carry these Agile practices into future work to stay flexible, efficient, and user-focused.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating effectively, taking responsibility, and supporting others to meet shared goals. In this project, I filled multiple roles—developer, tester, and Scrum Master—and learned how each role contributes to team success. Good teammates are adaptable, stay engaged during planning and reviews, and offer constructive feedback during retrospectives. Most importantly, they collaborate to overcome challenges and keep the project moving forward.
