CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle
Project Overview

This project focused on applying Agile principles to software development through the SNHU Travel project. The goal was to interpret user needs, translate them into actionable features, and deliver functional software iteratively. Key features included trip search and booking functionality, all guided by well-defined user stories to ensure alignment with real user expectations.

Reflection

Interpreting User Needs
I focused on understanding user goals and identifying features that provide the most value. Creating user stories helped transform those needs into actionable development tasks, clarifying what the user wanted and why. This approach ensured that the team built solutions that met real expectations.

Development Approach
I approached development iteratively, prioritizing core features first and refining them based on feedback. Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily standups, retrospectives, and backlog refinement were essential for staying organized and adaptable. This experience reinforced the importance of adjusting priorities mid-sprint to respond to stakeholder requests.

Teamwork and Collaboration
Being an effective team member meant communicating clearly, taking responsibility, and supporting others to meet shared goals. I assumed multiple roles—developer, tester, and Scrum Master—and learned how each role contributes to overall team success. Effective teammates are adaptable, engaged, and collaborative, providing constructive feedback and helping the team overcome challenges.
